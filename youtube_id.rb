# Generate YouTube IDs:
  # Challenge that I made up to create random YouTube style IDs
  # The results aren't truly random, it's just an exercise!

  # Write a method that takes two arguments:
    # length of the generated id, and total number of ids to generate
  # Generate unique alphanumeric ids based on the method's arguments
  # Don't duplicate ids
  # Return hash of unique ids

  def generate_ids(id_length,total_ids)
    ids = {}
  end

  generate_ids(10,5) # Generate 5 unique IDs with a length of 10
